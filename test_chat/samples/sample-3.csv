"I am trying to decide between to different job offers, I like both companies and their opportunities equally so I am trying to decide between them based on how they can help me financially. Company A is offering me 74,000 annual salary plus a 10,000 signing bonus with the possibility of a 5,000 annual bonus at the end of the year, depending on the company's and my own performance. Company B is offering me 74,000 annual salary plus a 15,000 stock option signing bonus. Both will match my 401k contibutions up to 5%. Based on these credentials, which company is offering me better benefits financially?"
"I don't know anything about the stock market but I am willing to learn, will Company B be better suited for me then?"
"What exactly does the signing bonus Company B is offering me mean?"
"What are vesting schedules? I don't know what that is."
"Since I don't know anything about the stock market, if I need money right away should I choose Company A"
