"I would like some financial advice on how I should start saving and paying off my debt as quickly as possible. I have about 30,000 in student debt and I currently make 60,000 a year. My monthly expenses include $750 for rent, about $200 for utilities and $60 for car insurance. Where should I start?"
"Given my current income and expenses will I be able to pay of my debt in the next 10 years? Is it possible? What are my options?"
"Given what I've said about my goals to pay off my student debt will I still have extra money to spend and/or save? What is the best way to save money with the highest growth rate?"
"Are Ibonds a good option for me over other ways to save money?"
