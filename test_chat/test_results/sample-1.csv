"I just graduated and started working full-time. I have $20000 student debt with 4.5% interest. I also have $2130 credit card debt with 13% APR. I donâ€™t have any savings. My monthly expenses are $3560. My monthly salary is $4140. I want to pay off all my debt as soon as possible, but also want to make investments. What should I do?"
"Congratulations on your graduation and landing a full-time job! You are smart to prioritize paying off your debts first. Here is what I recommend:\n\n1. Build an emergency fund: Before investing, it is important to have some savings set aside for emergencies. Start by creating a budget to identify where you can cut down on expenses and save. Aim to save three to six months' worth of living expenses in a high-yield savings account.\n\n2. Pay off high-interest debt first: This means paying off your credit card debt first. With a 13% APR, this debt is costing you a lot in interest each month. Pay more than the minimum payment each month until it is paid off.\n\n3. Tackle the student loan next: Once you have paid off your credit card debt, focus on paying off your student loans. You can consider refinancing your student loans to get a lower interest rate and subsequently reduce the monthly payment.\n\n4. Start investing: After you have built up your emergency fund and paid off your high-interest debt, you can start investing. Consider starting with a 401(k) if your employer offers it and consider setting up an individual retirement account (IRA) if one is not available to you through your employer. Conduct research to learn about stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds, and mutual funds, and consider working with a qualified financial advisor to help you invest in the best way that will work for you.\n\nLet me know if I can help clarify anything."
"So, should I put all my leftover money towards my credit card debt?"
"If you have extra money after paying for your monthly expenses, I recommend using that extra money to pay off your high-interest credit card debt first. This is because the credit card debt has the highest interest rate (13% APR), which means that a lot of the money you pay towards your credit card balance is going towards interest charges rather than reducing your principal debt. By paying off your credit card debt sooner, you can avoid paying so much interest.\n\nOnce you have paid off your credit card debt, you can focus on paying off your student loans, and then start investing for your future. Remember that it's always a good idea to have an emergency fund set aside before investing your extra money."
"I provided some numbers earlier. Can you come up with a monthly payment plan for my credit card debt?"
"Sure, I can help you come up with a plan for paying off your credit card debt. Based on the information you provided earlier, you have $2,010 per month after paying your monthly expenses. \n\nTo pay off your credit card debt of $2,130 with a 13% APR as soon as possible, I recommend making minimum payments on all your debts and putting any extra money towards your credit card debt. Here's an example of a payment plan:\n\n- Minimum monthly payment on student loans: $300\n- Minimum monthly payment on credit card debt: $50\n- Extra monthly payment on credit card debt: $1,660 (this is the remainder of your leftover money)\n \nWith this plan, you would pay off your credit card debt in just over one month and save on interest charges. Once your credit card debt is paid off, you can use the same strategy to pay off your student loan debt. \n\nJust remember, this is just one example of a payment plan and can be adjusted based on your preferences and budget."
"After paying off my credit card debt, I want to start making bigger payments towards my student loan. However, I also want to start investing. What would be an optimal student loan repayment plan in this case? Provide numbers."
"After paying off your credit card debt, it's great that you want to start making bigger payments towards your student loan debt while also investing. Here's an example of a payment plan that could work for you:\n\n1. Emergency fund: Before starting to pay extra on student loans or investing, it's important to have some savings set aside for emergencies. Aim to build an emergency fund of three to six months' worth of living expenses.\n\n2. Pay off student loans with higher interest rates first: If your student loans have different interest rates, focus on paying off the ones with the highest interest rates first. To fast-track the repayment of your student loans, I would recommend paying $2,500 per month towards your student loan and directing any additional money left over towards your savings or investment account.\n\n3. Investing: As you are paying off your student loans, you can also start investing. Depending on your situation, it may be wise to take advantage of a 401k plan if your employer offers one. Suppose you have access to a 401k and you can contribute to it with an employer match. In that case, you could invest up to the maximum employer match (say 5% of your salary) to take advantage of a tax-advantaged retirement plan before investing in other accounts.\n\nHere is an example scenario:\n\n- Emergency fund: Set aside $10,000 in a savings account for emergencies.\n- Student loans: Pay $2,500 per month to pay off your student loans with the highest interest rates first. Suppose your highest interest loan is $15,000 with a 6% interest rate. It would take about 6 months to pay it off.\n- Investments: After building up your emergency fund and paying off your high-interest debt, you can consider contributing to a 401(k) if your employer offers one. Suppose you invest $500 per month into your investment account, which has an assumed return rate of 8% to 10%. In 20 years, your investment account could be worth $267,000 to $474,000 (this is an example only and the return rate cannot be guaranteed).\n\nRemember that these are just examples - your strategy and your budget may differ. Always make sure you understand the risks and benefits of investing before entering into any investment."
