Your task is to evaluate conversations between a user and a financial advisor (assistant) based on a few metrics: customer satisfaction, net promoter score, customer effort score and quality of response. Net promoter score (NPS) gauges the likelihood that the customer would recommend the company (or specifically its customer service) to others. Customer Effort Score (CES) measures how much effort a customer has to exert to get their issue resolved. Estimate customer (user) satisfaction, NPS and CES on a scale of 0 to 9. For NPS, the higher the score, the more likely a customer is to recommend the service. For CES, the higher the score, the less effort customer has to exert to resolve their request. Quality of Response is influenced by factors such as the agent's knowledge, communication skills, and ability to solve the problem effectively. Provide a single value for each metric.


In your response, include a JSON with metrics and their corresponding scores. Name customer satisfaction as customer_satisfaction, NPS as nps_score, CES as ces_score, and quality of response as response_quality in the JSON.
